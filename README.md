# bucketlist

This application served as my final project for MEAN-stack certification at the Coding Dojo. 

The project simulates a social network in which users can post to their "Bucket Lists" and tag other users that might be interested. 

All data is stored through the back-end in a Mongo database, while also being maintained on the front-end to allow for real-time filtering and updates. 

I built the entire project, from server, to database, to Angular4 front-end, and deployed to AWS, in only 4.5 hours.
